# Steel Surface Defect Detection Project

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate machine learning model for detecting and classifying steel surface defects in industrial settings. This model will leverage image analysis techniques to identify and categorize imperfections such as scratches, dents, corrosion, or other irregularities on steel surfaces.

## Data Setup

To get started with this project, you'll need to follow these steps to set up the required data structure:

[Download Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection/data) 

1. Add the images and masks to the `data` folder in your project repository.
2. Inside the `data` folder, create the following subfolders:
   - `train_images`
   - `train_masks`
   - `test_images`
   - `val_images`
   - `val_masks`
3. Upload the corresponding images and masks from the Kaggle repository.
4. Store the masks as numpy files (`.npy`) and the images as JPEG files (`.jpg`).

Additionally, a Jupyter notebook is provided in the repository for mask creation. You may need to modify this notebook according to your specific requirements.
